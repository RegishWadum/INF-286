			<h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Music has, and always will be, an integral part of my life. I've been playing trumpet since the 6th grade (so 14 years. Longer than my sister has been alive!) I also play the flugelhorn, and recently I branched outside of the brass world and purchased a shamisen.</p>
            <h3>Drum Corps, and the Madison Scouts</h3>
            <p>This activity deserves its own category for many personal reasons. I have been doing drum corps with the Madison Scouts for 3 years (2019, 2021, and 2022). This activity was so life-changing for me that I don't know where I would be had I not auditioned.</p>
            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <p>I have been playing video games since I was about six years old, and is the reason why I'm in college for computer science! I met many of my lifelong friends through gaming and the internet. Despite us all being in a different part of the world, we always stay connected. Some of my favorite games include the following<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Halo (I am also a tester for the very first Halo fan game that has ever been released known as <a href="https://project-contingency.com/">Project Contingency</a>! Fun fact: My online alias was inspired by Halo.)</li>
					<li>Monster Hunter (I tend to hunt solo since I enjoy the challenge of facing massive beasts and dragons by myself)</li>
					<li>Anything that allows me to explore a vast world like Minecraft or No Man's Sky</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
            <h3>Other Cultures</h3>
			<p>One of my greatest fascinations is learning about other cultures. I want to be immersed in a culture that isn't my own, just to experience what it's like to see how other groups of people are. I also love learning languages. Aside from fluency in English, I am proficient in German. I also understand a bit of Brazilian-Portuguese, Spanish, some Swedish, and Romanian.</p>
